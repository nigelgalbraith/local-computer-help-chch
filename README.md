# Local Computer Help – Christchurch

This repository contains the source code for a simple static website used for my local computer help service in Christchurch, New Zealand.

The site is intentionally lightweight and framework-free. It exists to clearly explain the services offered, how I work, and how to contact me not to act as a portfolio or marketing platform.

## Purpose

- Provide clear information about local IT and computer help services
- Explain common problems and how they are approached
- Offer a straightforward way for people to get in touch

## Design Philosophy

- Simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Fast loading, minimal dependencies
- Easy to maintain and modify over time

## Deployment

The site is designed to be served as static files and can be hosted locally or on any basic web server.
